            I am someone who has been in Canada for five years now, exploring
            different fields of work and education.<br>
            My background is a mixed bag, having studied hard sciences in high
            school in India. After moving to Canada,
            I developed an interest in finance and decided to pursue a diploma
            in finance. Since then, I have gained
            three years of valuable professional experience working as a manager
            and in finance.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="para2P2">
            As I progressed in my career, I realized that computer science is a
            natural next step for me,
            as I am keen to delve into the field of analytics. I am fascinated
            by the potential of data-driven
            decision making and how it can drive innovation and growth. I am
            eager to learn new skills and apply
            my knowledge to create solutions that can have a meaningful impact.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p class="para3P2">
            Overall, my diverse background has equipped me with a unique set of
            skills and perspectives that I believe
            will help me succeed in my future endeavors. I am excited to see
            where my passion for finance and<br>
            computer science will take me, and I am always looking for new
            opportunities to learn and grow.
