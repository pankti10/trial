        <p>
          I've also included some of my personal interests, such as my favorite
          audio and a video that I think sums up why I'm so passionate about
          this field.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe that computer science is about more than just technical
          knowledge - it's about creativity, problem-solving, and making a
          positive impact on the world. That's why I've included a contact
          section and feedback form on this page
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to hear from you! Whether you're a fellow computer science
          enthusiast or just curious about this field, please feel free to reach
          out and share your thoughts.
        </p>

        <h3>I look forward to hearing from you!</h3>
